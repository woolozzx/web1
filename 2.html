  <p>
    The art of longboarding is timeless. You could easily say that longboard surfing is
    a state of mind. An idealized stage of mindfulness. It's the beginning and the end of wave riding.
    If you look up the word in a surf dictionary, the result is not as exciting as feels.
    Longboarding. A board that is long, too long, or longer than a standard board.
     We were taught that bigger isn't necessarily better but, in this particular case, it might be.
    Longboards are often called longboards only because shortboards appeared to take over during the infamous 1960s revolution.
    When surf planks became smaller, the original longboard era entered the pages of the surf history books.
    However, there are more longboarders in the world than you might think.
    Some of them are not full-time loggers; they own a respectable quiver of two or more boards.
    Believe or not, there's more to surfing than below six-foot beauties.
